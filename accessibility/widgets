	<h3>Dialogs</h3>
	<p>The demo dialog is activated by clicking on the "Trigger Dialog" button.</p>
	<p>When a modal dialog opens focus goes to the first focusable item in the dialog. Determining the first focusable item must take into account elements which receive focus by default (form fields and links) as well as items which may have a tabindex attribute with a positive value. If there is no focusable item in the dialog, focus is placed on the dialog container element.</p>
	<p>While the dialog contains focus, the tab order will wrap inside the dialog. If the dialog is modal, it is not possible to move focus to the main page until the dialog is closed.</p>
	<ul><li><b>ESCAPE</b> - open menu or submenu and returns focus to the parent menu item.</li></ul>

	<h3>Autocomplete</h3>
	<p>Typing into the text field will generate a dropdown list with auto-complete suggestions. The suggestions can be navigated using the arrow keys and selected using the Enter key.</p>
	<p>Autocomplete feedback is provided through an ARIA live region. To be announced properly, it must be used with an ARIA compliant browser and a screen reader that runs in (auto) forms mode or application mode.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>UP</b> - Move focus to the previous item. If on first item, move focus to the input.</li>
		<li><b>DOWN</b> - Move focus to the next item. If on the input, move focus to the first item.</li>
		<li><b>ESCAPE</b> - Close the menu.</li>
		<li><b>ENTER</b> - Select the currently focused item and close the menu.</li>
